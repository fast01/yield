    // Atomic reference-counted objects
    // Conventions for Objects:
    // Object* method( ... ) -> Object* is a new reference
    //   where method is usually a factory method.
    //   Factory methods that return Object& throw exceptions;
    //     those that return Object* return NULL instead.
    //   The exception to this rule are getters that return an Object*
    //   that is not a new reference
    // method( const Object& ) -> Object is on stack, not a new reference
    // method( Object* or Object* ) -> Object is on heap, but not a
    //   new reference; callee should inc_ref() references for itself
    //   as necessary
    // Exceptions to these conventions will be marked.
